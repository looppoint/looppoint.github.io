        <p align="justify">Harish Patil is a  Principal Engineer in a  Technology Path-finding and Innovation group at Intel Corporation. His areas of interest include static/dynamic program analysis (using “Pin/SDE” and “LLVM”), simulation point selection(“PinPoints”), record/replay (“PinPlay”), and debugging (“DrDebug”). Recipient of “ACM Programming Languages Software Award:2020” for co-developing the Pin program instrumentation framework. Co-author of two papers with  “Test-of-Time” awards based on Pin (PLDI 2005-2015) and  PinPlay (CGO 2010-2020). He has a Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, a B.Tech. and an M.Tech. from Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, and an MBA from Babson College.</p>

        <p align="justify">Trevor E. Carlson is an assistant professor at the National University of Singapore (NUS). He received his B.S. and M.S. degrees from Carnegie Mellon University in 2002 and 2003, his Ph.D. from Ghent University in 2014, and has worked for 3 years as a postdoctoral researcher at Uppsala University until 2017. He has over 13 years of computer architecture experience covering both industry and academia. His work on microarchitecture, simulation, sampling and modeling has seen three Best Paper Awards and three nominations for Best Paper. He has been developing techniques for high-efficiency processors that improve energy efficiency and performance by taking into account Memory Level Parallelism (MLP) together with unique architectural designs and software techniques. He co-authored the Sniper Multi-Core Simulator which has been used by hundreds of researchers to evaluate the performance and power efficiency of next-generation systems. His research interests include highly-efficient microarchitectures, hardware/software co-design, performance modeling, and fast and scalable simulation methodologies.</p>
